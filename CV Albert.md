#### DevOps Architect
Lead DevOps architect with 6 years of experience in designing, configuring, and implementing microservices-oriented architectures, DevOps practices, CI/CD, and container orchestration.
Throughout my journey, I have been involved in various stages of software development, from implementing cross-functional microservices to designing, configuring, and migrating the continuous integration cycle to a GitOps-based model orchestrated by Kubernetes.
