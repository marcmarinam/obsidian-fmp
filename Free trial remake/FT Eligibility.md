### Current solution
Right now, there's only one query that returns if a member is eligible for a free trial. That free trial is the main 14-day free trial and there's no way to check eligibility for a different journey.

### Proposal
The new query we want to implement will take a journey as a parameter. Eligibility for every journey may differ.
