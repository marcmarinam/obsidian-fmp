This is all the data we currently have at any given point during onboarding:
* Skipped nodes (ids and ahnenDab)
* Tree id
* Last added node id (id and ahnenDab)
* Root person id
* Selected person id
* The number of people added
* The number of generations reached

With a bit of tweaking, we can also have:
- Data about specific nodes added
- Added nodes (ids and ahnenDab)
