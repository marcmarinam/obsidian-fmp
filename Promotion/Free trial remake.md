### Section 1 - Focus on the impact the work had.
It allowed us to iterate and release experiments weekly based on different free trial journeys and durations. Tailored to specific customer experiences. This resulted in an increase of free trial uptakes and conversions (ADD REAL METRICS).
### Section 3 - Long term thinking
The work of phase 2 was carefully planned out to enable flexibility in experiments and features in the future.
#### Phase 1
We moved on from the usual 14-day free trial to offer customers any free trial length. This was a major task because a 14-day free trial had been the standard for years and was challenging to change.

We started using user journeys to set different free trial lengths and eligibility criteria.

Work I was involved in:
- Enabling dynamic length free trials in titan and ecomm-gate.
- Migrated eligibility logic from titan to ecomm-gate.
- Mapped different journeys to specific FT coupons in ecomm-gate.
#### Phase 2
Migrating from coupon-based free trials to coupon-less free trials. This allowed us to run experiments with any free trial lengths.

In order to allow data analysis we had to store free trial purchases in a database so we could know what journey a free trial was acquired from.

Work I was involved in:
- Migration from coupons to couponless.
- Developed the storage solution for all free trial purchases.
- Handled the launch of the remake and cleanup post-launch.
